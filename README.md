# HBP

HBP stands for HeartBeat Project,which means its mainly goal is to quicken your heartbeat or even a "heart attack"(lol)

If it doesn't then sorry to bother and thank you for your time.

# Why HBP

 I do not consider myself a real programmer,I just write code to solve problems for myself.
 
 When I in the middle of problems I need to relax and clear my mindï¼Œso here it comes.
 
# What does HBP do
 
 Nothing magic.It simply is a bunch of Scrapy spiders to crawl beauty picture and auto upload to the weibo images hosting then show themselves in a waterfall way.
 
 Right now it has almost 100000 pics.Here is the [DEMO](https://wuwayne.github.io/HBP/)
 
 Hope you enjoying!
